            Due to the fast-pacing technology nowadays, research databases became a substitute and option for research archives aside from libraries and museums. 
            A group of students therefore embarked on the idea of creating a research source that is systematic, user-friendly and accessible. PLMARD is an acronym for Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Marikina Research Database 
            initiated by Grade 12 STEM Students from Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Marikina. 
            It is made mainly to provide help for students academic pursuits and as a reference for research papers. 
            PLMARD showcases research archives that allows students to have access to wide varities of topics about researches. 
            The academic research database also showcases the works of PLMar students on their respective fields and studies. Aside from that, 
            PLMARD also serves as a conprehensive collection of information with wide-range topics. It showcases categories of research which makes it easier for students to access based on the type of research they are looking for. 
            The research database allows access to expert evaluated topics that students could use as references for their future research. The research database will not only benefit students but also teachers with the research guides 
            and discovery of different topics. It also benefits the institution by the implementation of outcome-based learning. It helps students to keep up with the rapid pace of technology development, making it easier of them to access reliable references and sources. 
            To know more about the developers and 
            researchers behind the academic research database, you may visit the <a href="aboutteam.php">About Team</a>  page.
