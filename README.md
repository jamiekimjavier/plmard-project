# plmard-project
PLMARD (Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Marikina Academic Research Database) is a secure web platform developed as my senior high school capstone project. It streamlines access to scholarly articles, protects data privacy, and helps students and advisers compile, share, and archive research papers efficiently.
